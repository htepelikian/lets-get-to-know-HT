            Hi there! I'm Hripsime, and I also go by Cristina. I am originally from Los Angeles, California. Since then, I have lived in Boston, Massachusetts and currently live in Berkeley, California. I am new to the coding world and loving every milestone. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Public Health, with which I have worked as a Neonatal Unit Secretary, Fertility Records Clerk, and have done Cancer Research.
